In any institution, an employee needs to get permission from his/her superior for taking any major action like order-
ing a new appliance or selecting a new vendor for supplies or for something as simple as taking a leave of absence.

We made a web portal for implementing two use cases of the above described idea, in which any employee of an
institute can raise an application for leave of absence or for proposing to take a project sponsored by external agencies.
The system worked on multi-level hierarchies that can be changed any time by system admin. Both functionalities
of the project had various constraints (like synchronisation of requests, approval and denial system, employee profile
management etc) which made it interesting to implement.

For using the project: 
Run a.py in cs301 folder, after installing required libraries in python.
